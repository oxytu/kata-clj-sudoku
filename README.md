A Sudoku Kata in Clojure
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oxytu/kata-clj-sudoku.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/oxytu/kata-clj-sudoku)


This project will implement a sudoku solver in clojure.
Currently it only has some basic functions to set-up a field and execute functions
on it. It serves as a learning exercise for clojure for me.
